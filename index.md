What will happen once input a url in a web browser then hit the enter button?
- Domain name server (DNS) iterator will ask root name server for fully qualified domain name (FQDN) then root name server will tell DNS iterator to check with top level domain (TLD) name server
- DNS iterator will then ask TLD name server for FQDN then TLD name server will tell DNS iterator to check with second level domain (SLD) name server
- DNS iterator will then ask SLD name server for FQDN then SLD name server will tell DNS iterator the IP address

What happened to the following url?
